            <p>
                My name is Jason Rettinger and welcome to my portfolio!<br><br>
                This is my first time coding. Prior to this boot camp, I was in the human resources field for approximately 15 years.<br> <br>
                Some of my duties included recruitment and hiring of senior level positions, payroll processing for approximately 500 employees and employee relations. <br><br>
                Outside of work and school, I like to collect vintage sports cards. My favorite card I own is a 1961 Fleer Wilt Chamberlain rookie card. <br><br> I am also a big time Pitt Panthers football fan. H2P!
